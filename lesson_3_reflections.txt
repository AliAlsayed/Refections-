When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	remote when you’re collaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	you might not want to use the changes that someone else made on the projects.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	I’d clone if I have permission to make changes, Fork if I don’t. Branches If I am working locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It’s good to know where you stand in terms of collaboration. Ahead or behind?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	If it’s a small project, through email. The bigger it is the more we need github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	if I am experimenting with a feature i’d go with a branch unless we are working on something that is core.
