How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    the + and - did the trick.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    as projects get bigger, it’s useful to look back at the last version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   programming is an executable practice. so it’s good know what the changes are.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because of collaborative nature of programming.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   about to learn.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know I have a checkpoint to start again from.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can see my own progress.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	because in programming, usually multiple files are connected like HTMl & CSS.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log to view the history. git diff to know the difference between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	pretty confident.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	managing my projects!
